#  At this point we added the responisve file  versus the full site.  
## The first comparison was Reed.co.uk  

>>Reed.co.uk
For the first comparison we used [reed.co.uk](http://reed.co.uk)  

![Reed website img](reed_site.png)  
As you can see the comparison shows that 
 - When the responsive site is show, content is reduced to display most relevant details first.  
 - Images are reduced in size so as to use up less bandwidth
 - Images are smaller for quicker loading.
 - the background is left plain for quicker loading and ease of viewing as the screen is smaller and doesnt need to be busy


## Our second comparison was the BBC Radio 1 Website  
>>BBC Radio 1
The site is viewable at [bbc.co.uk/radio1/](http://bbc.co.uk/radio1)  

![Radio 1 website img](radio1_site.png)  
As you can see the comparison shows that 
 - When the responsive site is shown, content is reduced to display most relevant details only.  
 - Images are reduced to only those relevant to current song and logo
 - menu is minimal with only popular ones and a hamburger menu for more menu items.
 - the background is no longer an image but a vector color, 

## Finally the BBC News Website  
>>BBC News
The site is viewable at [bbc.co.uk/](http://bbc.co.uk/)  

![BBC website img](bbc_site.gif)  
As you can see the comparison shows that similar to the radio 1 website 
 - The background remains plain for faster loading 
 - Images are reduced to only those relevant to latest news
 - Menu and search bars are minimised.
 - Unecessary welcome text has been dropped
