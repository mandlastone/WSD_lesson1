<sub>Some random fact here</sub>

``` html

```

#  At this point we added the responisve file  versus the full site.  
## The first comparison was Reed.co.uk  

>>Reed.co.uk
For the first comparison we used [reed.co.uk](http://reed.co.uk)  

![Reed website img](reed_site.png)  
As you can see the comparison shows that 
 - When the responsive site is show, content is reduced to display most relevant details first.  
 - Images are reduced in size so as to use up less bandwidth
 - Images are smaller for quicker loading.
 - the background is left plain for quicker loading and ease of viewing as the screen is smaller and doesnt need to be busy
